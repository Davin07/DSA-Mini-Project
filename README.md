Ciphering and Deciphering Text 

A cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.

The operation of a cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information, called a key (also known as a cryptovariable). The encrypting procedure is varied depending on the key, which changes the detailed operation of the algorithm. A key must be selected before using a cipher to encrypt a message. Without knowledge of the key, it should be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable plaintext. 

Modern encryption methods can be divided by two criteria: by type of key used, and by type of input data.

By type of key used ciphers are divided into:

    symmetric key algorithms (Private-key cryptography), where one same key is used for encryption and decryption

    asymmetric key algorithms (Public-key cryptography), where two different keys are used for encryption and decryption.

Ciphers can be distinguished into two types by the type of input data:

    block ciphers, which encrypt block of data of fixed size

    stream ciphers, which encrypt continuous streams of data.
